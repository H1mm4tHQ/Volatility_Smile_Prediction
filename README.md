# Implied Volatility (IV) Prediction and Visualization

This project analyzes and visualizes the **Implied Volatility (IV)** structure for option prices ‚Äî focusing on the _volatility smile_ and _volatility surface_. The notebook and supporting code estimate IV for call and put options, plot the IV curves, and interpret the results in terms of market moneyness.

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

### 1. Black‚ÄìScholes Model

For a non-dividend-paying asset, the **Black‚ÄìScholes option pricing formula** is:

\[
C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
\]

\[
P = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1)
\]

where:
\[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}, \quad
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
\]

| Symbol         | Meaning                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| \( C, P \)     | Call and Put option prices           |
| \( S_0 \)      | Current spot price of the underlying |
| \( K \)        | Strike price                         |
| \( r \)        | Risk-free interest rate              |
| \( T \)        | Time to maturity (in years)          |
| \( \sigma \)   | Implied volatility                   |
| \( N(\cdot) \) | Cumulative normal distribution       |

### 2. Implied Volatility (IV)

Implied Volatility (\( \sigma\_{impl} \)) is the value of \( \sigma \) that satisfies the Black‚ÄìScholes price given an observed market option price.

That is:

\[
C*{market} = BS*{call}(S*0, K, r, T, \sigma*{impl})
\]

Since there is no closed-form solution for \( \sigma\_{impl} \), it is found **numerically** using iterative methods like:

- **Newton‚ÄìRaphson**, or
- **Bisection Method**

### 3. Moneyness and the Volatility Smile

Moneyness is defined as:

\[
M = \frac{K}{S_0}
\]

- **At-The-Money (ATM)**: \( M = 1 \)
- **In-The-Money (ITM)**: \( M < 1 \)
- **Out-of-The-Money (OTM)**: \( M > 1 \)

Empirically, IV tends to form a **U-shape** (called a _volatility smile_) when plotted against \( K \) or \( M \).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- **Core Libraries:**
  - `numpy` ‚Äì mathematical operations
  - `pandas` ‚Äì data loading and manipulation
  - `scipy.optimize` ‚Äì for implied volatility root finding
  - `matplotlib` ‚Äì plotting volatility surfaces and smiles

### Workflow:

1. Load input option chain data.
2. Compute IV for calls and puts via numerical root-finding.
3. Compute **moneyness (K/S)** and **strike-wise IV curves**.
4. Plot:
   - IV vs Strike
   - IV vs Moneyness (Smile)

## üìä Results

The following plots visualize the **volatility surface** and **smile** structure:

|                Volatility Surface                | Volatility Smile |
| :----------------------------------------------: | :--------------: |
| ![Volatility Smile Plot](./volatility_smile.png) |                  |

**Interpretation:**

- IV is minimum at the _ATM strike_ and rises symmetrically for ITM/OTM options.
- The smile pattern implies **non-constant volatility**, contradicting the constant volatility assumption of Black‚ÄìScholes.
- This reflects **market sentiment** ‚Äî deep ITM and OTM options are priced with higher IV due to tail risk.

---

## üß† Possible Extensions

- Fit **parametric volatility surfaces** (SABR, Heston models).
- Train ML regressors (e.g., XGBoost or LSTM) for IV forecasting.
- Add 3D volatility surface visualization over time-to-expiry.
